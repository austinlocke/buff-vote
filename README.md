## Development server

Before running the project, ensure you have Node.js downloaded, then with the npm command line tool ensure you have the angular-cli tool by running `npm install -g @angular/cli`, then run `npm install` (inside the project directory) to get the latest dependencies for the project.

Run `ng serve` to start up a development server for the angular code, then run `node server.js` to start up the backend server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/` inside a browser to view the application. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
